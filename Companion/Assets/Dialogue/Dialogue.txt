## Vague murmuring under breath and to self ##  

...How can I get out of here... where's Lumpy when you need them... I really need to find a way out, but I just.. why can't I move.. this is so frustrating... 

## Picking Up ##

Oh! Who are you? You know what, doesn't matter, can you help me get out of here? 

I've been stuck here for days and haven't been able to find a way out... or... how to move for that matter. I seem to be some... sort of blob now. 

But now you're here! Together I'm sure we can find a way out of this box and back to civilization. Come on, let's take a look around.

## Wall Opens ##

...Well that's convenient. I guess we're a winning combination *haha*

 What on earth.. or off earth is this place? I hope we can find our way out of here... 

## First Fall ##

- fade out any existing dialogue -

Oh god oh god oh god oh god... 

*Land* 

Oh! We're back! *Relieved laughter* 

I guess... I guess we're really stuck here...

- 5 second pause ff there was dialogue - 

Well, as I was saying.. 

## First Trigger ## 

You seem like the quiet type but that's okay, I could really use someone to talk to. 

So I can tell we're both thinking it... this must be some sort of afterlife, isn't it? A limbo for lost souls. 

It's funny though, I don't remember dying. Maybe that means it's not too late? 

I'm sure we can find a way out of this, I know we can. We just gotta keep pressing forward. 

## Second Trigger ## 

Thanks again, for taking me with you. People aren't... people aren't usually that good to me. 

Well except my dog Lumpy, the last few years he's been the best friend I've ever had. 

God I hope he's been doing okay without me there. It's not fair of me to leave, *speeding up emotional* I promised I'd take care of him, and after all he's done taking care of me when I've needed him... 

*big sigh*

We need to find a way out of here. 

## Third Trigger ## 

I know it must seem silly to you that here I am, a blob surrounded by glowing cubes, and yet my greatest concern is my dog but... 

He's more than that. He's the only person that's really cared about me.

## Throw Lumpy ## 

Oh.......

## Keep Lumpy ## 

Oh!.. Thanks for sticking with me.. Whatever comes next, I'm glad we won't have to confront it alone.
